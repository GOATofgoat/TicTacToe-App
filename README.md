This is a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python, created as a practice project to strengthen fundamental programming skills. The game runs in the terminal and allows two players to take turns placing X and O on a 3×3 board while the program checks for wins, invalid moves, and draws.

FEATURES:

Two-player mode (local play)

Automatic detection of win, loss, or draw

Prevents invalid moves (cannot play on an occupied space)

Simple and clean gameplay loop

Clear text-based board display
